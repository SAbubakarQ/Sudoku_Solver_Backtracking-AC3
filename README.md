 ## Sudoku Solver: Using Backtracking and Arc Consistency - 3 Algorithms

To compile all the files:
    1. type 'python3 Sudoku_solver.py' into the terminal

The user will be prompted with the first test case. Then they will choose wheather to run 
backtracking algorithm or Arc Consistency algorithm. If they choose to move to the next 
test case, they type X and it will promote them the the second test case. There are three
test cases total. 

After all test cases are complete, the program will end. 

# Additional Information

I first implemented the backtracking algorithm and tried to better understand the method
on how to implement it into code. I used resources on the internet to and added comments
displaying all that I learned. 

Issues arrose when trying to read from an AC3 algorithm. I had it working on test cases but
not properly. When I ran it through the separate file, my parameter argument was causing issues.
